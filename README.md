-- Instructions

Go to your Discord Developer Portal and Make a New Application

Then, Copy your Application ID and put it into the client.lua Where it says to insert it. 

Next you want to add the Bot to your Discord Server, so go to OAuth2 -> URL Generator -> Then Select Bot -> Then Select Administrator -> Copy the Link at the Bottom of the Page, and Paste in your Search Bar, then add it to the desired server.

Now, to add in your Logos, and Buttons. 

First, go to Rich Presence, then Art Assets. For the Cover Image, put your Logo. For the Rich Presence Assets, put anything you want. Then, copy the Asset Image Name, and Paste it in the Correct One. The Large Image should go where it says to put the large image, and the same for the small image, where it says to put the small image. 

Next, you want to add your Buttons. So, you want to go Line 32, in client.lua, and where it says "Button Text 1" replace that with whatever you'd like. Then, where it says "Button 1 Link" Put whatever you want there, but it must start with "fivem://connect/" or "https://". 

Now do the Same thing for The Second Button.
